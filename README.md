Developed using React, [thankfull](https://gratitudejournal.alexandralim.dev/) is a virtual gratitude journal that allows the user to log their daily entry and review any previously logged entries. This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).
